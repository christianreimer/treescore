        <h2>Computer Vision to Amuse and Delight</h2>
        
        <p>
        Obsessing over the distribution of your Christman Twingle Lights? Wondering if your tree is standing 
        straight, or maybe leaning just a little bit to wards the wall? Too many red ribbons? Not enough glitter? 
        Too many ornaments over here and a big gap over there?
        </p>
        
        <h3>Light Uniformity Score</h3>
        <p>
        To detemine the uniformity of the lights on the tree, I first locate all the lights by identifying the 
        brightest regions of the image, and assume the center of each region correspond to a light. Then, for each light, 
        I take the average distance between that light and its three closest neighbors. Finally, I take the standard 
        deviation of all these averages. In addition, I want to reward trees that have more lights (while still maintaining 
        uniformity), so the score is scaled up by the number of lights.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The score returned is calculated as
        <pre><code>light_score = 100 - log(num_lights) * std_dev(avg_light_dist)</code></pre>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Tree Shape Score</h3>
        <p>
        The shape of the tree is compared to a triangle with the ratio of XX/YY. Where did that come from? I measured 
        a picture of a trees that I found to be visually appealing ... Yes, completely subjective. In addition to judging 
        the height/width ratio, I compare the observed angle of the tree (from the middle point between bottom left and 
        bottom right corners to the top) with a vertical line and calculate the angle in degrees.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The score returned is calculated as
        <pre><code>shape_score = 100 - abs(ideal_ratio - observed_ratio) * angle</code></pre>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Color Score</h3>
        <p>
        The ideal Christmas colors are green, red, gold, and white. I somewhat arbitrarely decidede that a pleasent 
        distribution of colors was 50% green, 20% red, 20% gold, and 10% white. So that is what I am scoring on.
        </p>
        
        <p>The score returned is calculated as
<pre><code>color_score = 100 - sum(abs(ideal_ratio[c] - observed_ratio[c])
                        for c in ['green', 'red', 'gold', white'])</code></pre>
        </p>

        <h3>Combined Score</h3>
        <p>
        Finally the scores are combined
        <pre><code>total_score = sum(light_score, shape_score, color_score) / 3</code></pre>
        </p>

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
          Start out with an images of a nice tree
          <img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christianreimer/treescore/gh-pages/image.png'/>
        </p>
    
        <p>To locate the lights, a threshold is applied to the image to find the brightest regions, which produces
        the following image.

          Afterwards, the center of each bright region is found, and each of these (x, y) pairs is considered
          a light.
