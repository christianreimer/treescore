        <h3>Computer Visision to Amuse and Delight</h3>
        Ok yes both of you hit points that went in to consideration while we were thinking about this:
1) we don't want the current (& maybe confusing) navigator restrictions of B1
2) we have users using the above restrictions, so we'd have to think twice before overhauling the functionality completely

We are completely open to finding a better solution that might not be ours, so Adam your feedback is good. The question then, is how do we give the user more freedom? The options are:
a) provide some non-sticky filter options on the ticket - too flexible, user has to change filters each time. Good if user likes waking up in "no filter" mode and then plays around.
b) provide sticky filter - mix between flexibility & stickiness. Not good for above use case, but sounds like a reasonable solution for most
c) provide setting - least flexible, and yet another setting. Good for people who like their defaults & don't change them much. Saves real estate compared to (a), but more annoying to change
