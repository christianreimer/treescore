        <h3>Computer Vision to Amuse and Delight</h3>
        
        <p>Obsessing over the distribution of your Christman Twingle Lights? Wondering if your tree is standing straight, or maybe leaning just a little bit to wards the wall? Too many red ribbons? Not enough glitter? Too many ornaments over here and a big gap over there?</p>
        
        <h3>Light Uniformity Score</h3>
        To detemine the uniformity of the lights on the tree, we first locate all the lights by identifying the brightest regions of the image. Then, for each light, I take the average distance between that light and its 3 closest neighbors. Finally, I take the standard deviation of all these averages. In addition, I want to reward trees that have more lights (while still maintaining uniformity), so the score is scaled up by the number of lights. The speficic score returned is calculated as
        
        <code>
          score = 100 - ((3 / log(number_of_lights) * std_dev(average distance between beighboring lights)
          </code>
